*NOTE: Still a Work-in-progress*

**Data Explorer is a web application designed for quickly exploring CSV datasets, made entirely with R shiny + other R packages.**

It provides various tools for data visualization, summary statistics, and exploratory data analysis, and was inspired by a course assignment I had at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand.
