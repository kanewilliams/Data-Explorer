(WIP)

Data Explorer is a web application designed for quickly exploring CSV datasets, made entirely in R shiny and other R packages.

It provides various tools for data visualization, summary statistics, and exploratory data analysis, and was inspired by an assignment I had in (DATA423: Data Science in Industry) at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand.
